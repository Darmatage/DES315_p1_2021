I am not alive, but I grow
I don't have lungs, but I need air
I don't have a mouth, but water kills me
What am I?

What is full of holes but still holds water?




What is always in front of you but can't be seen?




What goes up but never comes down?




I have branches, but no fruit, trunk or leaves.
What am I?
